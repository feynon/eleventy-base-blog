Being a student definitely doesn't help me with getting the arsenal I dream of but still whatever I've had managed to get off my holy dad's money, here's all of it:

## Devices


### Desktop with a Twist （ˣ∇ˣ）: Dell Inspiron 7567 Gaming  15.6"

It's a laptop tho I mostly like to treat him as more of a desktop. A desktop which is portable and can be carried between rooms if one is willing to plus have some muscles. It's technically a gaming laptop which had been featured in an Ant Man movie and boasts <!--more-->red grills, fans and sheer desktop-like power (**i7 Kaby Lake, 8 GB DDR4 RAM, 126 GB SanDisk SSD coupled with 1 TB HDD, 4 GB GDDR5 GTX 1050 Ti GPU**)  inside. I'm very proud of the system and it's work power but it just lets himself down by his sheer weight, which is like around two and a half kg's making it nearly impossible to call it portable at all. I initially bought it in April 2k18 for $ 1400 in thoughts that I would game like a maniac but with days my interests delved from gaming to cinema/books/development. Currently, his Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 TI and two fans mostly lie dormant for most of the time.

Also, there is room for an another 2.5 in HDD or SSD and a RAM slot which I plan on adding someday but for now it's all going more than fine.
I dream of getting a MacBook Pro or Lenovo's Thinkpad someday.

### Laptop: Dell Latitude 3180 11.6"

I bought this originally in October for a mere $300 for performing biologically hazard radioactive tasks like testing out distros, etc so that it doesn't break off my daily workflow on my main machine. It has a nice 128GB Samsung SSD and 4 GB RAM and a nice chiclet comfortable keyboard to dab on though it's display and viewing angles lacks heavily. This laptop comes in a Chromebook variant as well. I had once tried once installing chromium OS based Gallium OS once, also android x86 project but touch-drivers got messed up.

I wished I would've got a Raspberry Pi instead if I knew about it well enough back then. He also suffers loneliness for weeks along and gets thrown away at strange places.

### Phone: Nokia 5.1 Plus

Until 5 months back I had a Motorola Moto G6 which got its motherboard washed out in water due to a funny incident if tomato ketchup going in it's USB port.

 I decided to go with now HMD owned Nokia phone primarily because of my emphasis on two-pointers, first getting constant assured software updates (as it's an android one affiliated phone it serves the purpose well) and second robust build quality and design. I am not honestly over obsessed with specs and just want to get basic things done so at a price of ₹ 9500 (~$ 138) was a pretty good deal to get from Flipkart.

I rely on airtel as carrier of my choice after I switched from Reliance's Jio due to network congestion problems. Just FYI I was served with (in sequence) Karbonn Titanium S5 (some rebranded Blu Studio phone), Moto G, moto G5+ coming to my last moto G6 before giving up completely with the Lenovo shattered Motorola of the current generation.

### Tablets: iPad Mini 1st Gen

It's rather just too old, but it apparently still boots up and I use it to relive my nostalgia browsing it's photo gallery. I used the iPad extensively for those 2 years of senior school where we weren't allowed cell phones. These Apple things last as hell. Also, I do own a shattered Google Nexus 7 2013 WiFI model which I initially brought for ROM and Android hacking stuff, and oh boy those were the golden days :).

It only gets the privilege of getting charged when a friend of mine who has apple lightning charger is near.

### E-Reader: Kindle Paperwhite WiFi 2018

I enjoyed reading books since my dad once gifted a family encyclopedia and an atlas to me when I was in 8th grade. Since then I grew up an obsession to books of varying genres at different ages, more on that in some another blog post.

I went with this particular model of Kindle because it was IP rated and I've had always been obsessed with waterproof things and urge to wash my gadgets. Secondly, it has a backlight which allows me to read inside blankets whenever I wish. He sometimes gets no attention for a week straight though but when he gets it's on a binge.


## Accessories

### Headphones: Brainwavz HM5 Studio Monitor 

It's essentially a rebranded alternative to widely popular Fischer Audio FA-003 in audiophile communities which comes for half as fewer bucks. I bought this $110 out of my audiophilic obsessions.

I also got a [Fiio A1](https://www.fiio.co.in/products/fiio-a1-portable-headphone-amplifier) amplifier for getting it work with my low powered mobile devices. Given it's impedance rating at 64Ω it gets hard for mobile devices to get them to full volumes though my current Nokia manages just fine.

### Earphones: Sony MDR-EX150AP In-Ear

Nothing special to flaunt with, I never went high end with in-ear audio devices till now but wish to get a truly wireless one someday. Didn't bought the XB (Extra Bass) ones because I am no fan of those bass heavy consumer audio heads but I prefer more of closer to a natural tone when it comes to it.

### Watch: Casio G688 G-Shock Digital

I bought this timepiece inspired by my ever fav Eminem who can be seen wearing this in Space Bound song. Later a special Eminem themed edition of this watch was released as well, but I was unable to find that red black beauty in the Indian market. He is not only rugged but stylish streetwise with that hip-hop element in it's look.

### Storage

- **Segate Backup Plus 1TB External HDD**
- **HP x765w 16GB USB 3.0**: One of best affordable USB 3 device out there in Indian market.

**Notable mention** :  MYGT C04 Wireless Bluetooth Gamepad Controller (No longer used, but it's hot)

## Travel

- **HP Odyssey Laptop Backpack**
This thing goes much far ahead than a mere laptop backpack, I've used it a week ago for my trek needs and boy, it performed more than my expectations. It comes with dedicated pockets for a tablet or an e-reader, many compartments for my other gadgets, strong zips, grab handle in front and anti-theft padded laptop compartment. 
I'll spare throwing a picture of particularly not so techy stuff here. :/

## Software

### Linux Setup
On my main workstation Dell Inspiron I have the following specs:
- OS: Pop!_OS 19.04 by System 76
- Desktop environment: GNOME 3.30
-  Base: Ubuntu

**Pop!_OS Desktop on Inspiron**

And on my experimental Dell Latitude when not under radioactive tasks I prefer the following set up which is easily installed to the last restore point with help of snapshot feature in MX Tools of the MX Linux distribution:
- OS: MX Linux 18 Continuum
- Desktop environment: XFCE 4.13
- Base: Debian

**MX Linux Desktop on Latitude**

![](https://imgur.com/download/RXkQish)

Don't judge me on the choice of Linux distro and DE I have. I have pretty much distro hopper for most of my times with few exceptions of settling on Ubuntu Budgie, Kubuntu and Manjaro KDE for a while. I tried almost everything out there counting out manual installations of Gentoo and Arch but nothing really worked for me out of the box than _**Pop!_OS**_ honestly. The stability and just the very basic functionality with added apps like Popsicle and a cool slim dark shell theme makes it my go-to choice when recommencing anyone a **no fancy just go to that works** Linux distribution. _**MX Linux**_ is one another great distro with the similar philosophy but with a lot more which comes all packaged in MX Tweaks utility which makes almost management and tooling come at you without actually adding anything. When it's not Pop!_OS it's always MX Linux for me though I would have preferred slightly more visual glamour than the flat old XFCE desktop.
 I mostly stick to defaults for peace of my mind.
 
My GNOME extensions include excluding the default ones that come shipped with Pop!_OS!:
- **CPU Power Manager** : Let's me scale CPU frequencies and Turbo Boost to my needs
- Clipboard Manager
- **Dash to Panel**
- **GS Connect**
- Removable Drive Menu
- **Screenshot Tool**
- Sound Input and Output Device Chooser
- Lock Keys
- Extension Update Notifier
- Open Weather

*PS: I plan to post a more detailed section with dotfiles and stuff on a later timeframe.
PS2: Just for a note on no mention of Windows all along the section, I did carried Windows until my laptop was 11 months old and then completely disposed of it off as my only need gaming went pale.*

### Linux Apps

I would be listing only the ones that I use most frequently and are notable
- **VS Code**
- Firefox
- **Riot.im**
- Slack
- Spotify
-  **Keybase**
- **Tillix**
- **Dropbox**
- Calibre
- Wine
- GitHub Desktop
- **Zeal Docs**: An app with updated offline documentation for almost all languages based on Dash
- Telegram
- VLC Media Player

### Android Setup
I wished the phone had an unlockable boot-loader so that I could've flashed custom ROMs on it, but unfortunately such is not the case with this. So for customization I am restricted to iOS customization ie. changing the wallpaper and home screen style, lol.

**Homescreen**

###  Android Apps
As my phone is an android one device it lies hostage to most of Google spying apps and I don't resist or care much though I plan to go Google less one day soon it's not on my priority for now at least.
Here are the apps I mostly use, but it's nothing notable here I guess:

- Finance: PayPal, GPay, PayPal

- Music: Spotify, Pano last.fm Scrobbler, musicXmatch
- Social: Reddit, Whatsapp, Telegram, Twitter, Messenger, Riot.im, Tusky(for mastodon)
- Productivity: Google Keep, Notion, Feedly, Dropbox, Solid Explorer, Google Keyboard
- Food: Swiggy, UberEats, Zomato
- Browser: Chrome, Firefox Preview

### Browser Extensions

- Ad Block Plus (ABP)
-  **Dark Reader**
- Sound Fixer
- **Save to Notion**
- Lockwise by Firefox
- **Checker Plus for Gmail**
